# COLOUR DETECTION
1. localize the position of the glass in the image by using the track bar 
2. Detect the pouring cereal by colour decided by HSV values 
3. Ratio between the region on cereal and bounding box.
4. There is an angle between the camera and glass so the caclulation of percentage has a tolerance of about 5% based on experiments. Eg: if we want to pour 50% the result can be between 45 to 55.
